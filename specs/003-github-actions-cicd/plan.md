# Implementation Plan: GitHub Actions を用いた CI/CD 基盤の構築

**Feature Branch**: `003-github-actions-cicd`
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: Planning

## Technical Context

-   **Technologies**:
    -   **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions
    -   **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
    -   **Containerization**: Docker
    -   **Application Stack**: Python (FastAPI)
    -   **Cloud Provider**: AWS
    -   **Container Registry**: Amazon ECR
    -   **Testing Frameworks**: Pytest
    -   **Linting**: Ruff

-   **Dependencies**:
    -   Source code repository on GitHub.
    -   Access to an AWS account for infrastructure provisioning.
    -   An Amazon ECR repository.

-   **Integration Points**:
    -   GitHub Actions workflows will be triggered by git events.
    -   Terraform will interact with the AWS API.
    -   The CI pipeline will push Docker images to Amazon ECR.
    -   The CD pipeline will deploy images from ECR to the AWS ECS environment.

-   **Key Decisions Made**:
    -   **Cloud Provider**: AWS was chosen due to existing Terraform configurations and robust managed services.
    -   **Container Registry**: Amazon ECR was selected for its seamless integration with AWS.
    -   **Linting Tool**: Ruff was chosen for its high performance and all-in-one capabilities.
    -   **Hosting Service**: AWS ECS will be used to run the containerized application.
    -   **Terraform State Management**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: S3 backend, Terraform Cloud, etc.]
    -   **Secrets Management**: GitHub Encrypted Secrets will be used for the CI/CD pipeline.

*(This check is based on the template constitution and will be updated once the project's actual constitution is defined.)*

## Quality & Security Gates

-   **Testing**: All new infrastructure code must be accompanied by appropriate tests (e.g., integration tests for Terraform modules). All application code changes must pass existing and new unit tests.
-   **Linting**: All code (Python, Terraform) must pass linting checks with Ruff.
-   **Security**:
    -   No hardcoded secrets in the codebase or Terraform files. Secrets will be managed via GitHub Encrypted Secrets.
    -   Container images will be scanned for vulnerabilities using Amazon ECR's built-in scanner.
    -   IAM roles and policies will follow the principle of least privilege.
-   **Review**: All pull requests must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member.
